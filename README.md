# DC Urban Heat Change Analysis (2015â€“2025)

This repository analyzes changes in land surface temperature (LST) in Washington, DC using **Landsat 8 thermal imagery**, **land cover data**, and **census income data**. The project explores how urban heat island (UHI) effects have evolved over a 10-year period and investigates potential correlations with socioeconomic indicators.

We integrate zonal statistics, robust regression, outlier detection, and OSINT analysis of climate-related news to contextualize urban heat change and its spatial patterns.

**Live data + interactive maps** are too large to host here. You can [access them on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YKCJtaHW_XrL2SuLIOhImUCbyeQlTM-B?usp=drive_link).

## Summary of Findings

- Surface temperatures increased in most of DC from June 2015 to June 2025.
- Raw Î”T (temperature change) reached as high as **+63.5Â°F** in some zones â€” later flagged as outliers and removed.
- After z-score filtering (Â±3), most Î”T values ranged from **-5Â°F to +5Â°F**.
- **Robust regression** using median household income shows no statistically significant association with heat gain (p > 0.99).
- **AI-enhanced OSINT analysis** of climate headlines suggests intensifying summer heatwaves in DC but no consistent spatial explanation for heat spikes.

## Methodology

### Input Data

| Type | Source |
|------|--------|
| **Thermal Bands** | Landsat 8 ST_B10 (2015 & 2025) |
| **Land Cover** | `Annual_NLCD_LndCov_2024_CU_C1V1.tif.aux` |
| **Vector Boundary** | DC extent used to clip rasters |
| **Census Income** | Median household income via Census API (GEOID merge) |
| **News OSINT** | Geotagged articles filtered for heat-related terms |

### Analysis Workflow

1. **Temperature Conversion**
   - Landsat DN â†’ LST Kelvin â†’ Â°C â†’ Â°F

2. **Land Cover Classification**
   - NLCD classes mapped to Urban, Vegetation, Water, Other

3. **Zonal Statistics**
   - Per-polygon mean temps (2015, 2025)
   - Î”T (Temp_2025 â€“ Temp_2015) calculated

4. **Outlier Filtering**
   - Z-score filter applied to Î”T
   - Data capped to 1stâ€“99th percentile

5. **Regression Modeling**
   - `statsmodels.RLM` with HuberT norm
   - Dependent: Î”T, Independent: Median income
   - Non-significant relationship detected

6. **OSINT Integration**
   - GPT-4 model used to cross-analyze geotagged headlines
   - Summary adds narrative layer to spatial change data
